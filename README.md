ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @16359

A tireless seeker of knowledge, an occasional purveyor of wisdom and the epitome of the arrogance of youth.

I started building websites as a freelancer at the age of 15 in a small town of India. 7 Years later I had everything in place, a Bachelors in Computer Applications, a Advance Diploma in 3D Animation, a few certificates from having played football (not american) for the state, district, and school as a backup for if I fail in my endeavors. I started my own company desiging websites and creating digital marketing campaigns. I built a good team and grew my business for 3 years and lead a pretty succesful venture while staying true and honest without any moral compromises.

On account of reading one too many books I have come to the realization that my lifestyle of constantly pushing myself, barely getting enough sleep, having outside food is probably not healthy ðŸ¤¯. I have been relentless in my work and have not lived a standard life that most kids get to. I have skipped so many steps of development that I now have to go back and relearn them all.

I feel like its a terrible thing to be working for 10 years just to be burnt out. So in this jouney, I am gonna explore things that I love, build up a career and then a company from scratch, while trying to speed run into a burnout.
